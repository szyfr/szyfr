<h2 align="center">Hello</h2>
<p align='center'>I'm Joshua Zemenski, a wannabee game developer with a degree in Software Engineering. For now though I spend my time prototyping ideas and learning new things. I do have a small number of projects I'm working on, but it's hard to make a game when you have no artistic ability. I do make up for my lack of art skills with a Go-Getter attitude and an incredible amount of sarcasm.</p>

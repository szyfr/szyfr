<h2 align="center">Hello</h2>
<p align='center'>I'm Josh Zemenski, a wannabee game developer with a degree in Software Engineering. For now though I spend my time prototyping ideas and learning new languages and technologies. I usually have multiple projects going on at any given time, and all my current projects are the pinned repositories. While I work hard at all of my projects, not a lot tend to ever get 100% finished due many reasons, but usually due to my lack of artistic ability.</p>
